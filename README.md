## Storm E-Commerce sight

I created a mock store using Django and Python as well as using a new tech Vue for my front end. I challanged my self to test my django and python skills and was able to quickly add Vue to my skills as well. I created a full stack web app that allows you to sign up, sign in, add things to cart (even if you aren't signed in), as well as being able to checkout.

The backend is able to be accesed using rest-framework and products, orders, users, and cateogires can be viewed by the admin.

## Stretch Goals

I need to fix the ordering process, I successfuly added strip but I am having issues getting the checkout button to load in order to move to the credit card info.
